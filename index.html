        <p>In a study conducted by researchers at Washington University, 7% of the retired players surveyed said they had used more prescription pain medication than they had been prescribed in the last 30 days.</p>

        <p>Today, retired NFL athletes seek marijuana as a pain-managing alternative to opioids. Addiction to painkillers such as opioids is a problem that the NFL has had since its inception.</p>

        <p>“Marijuana is one of the potential non-opioid alternatives that can relieve pain at a relatively lower risk of addiction and virtually no risk of overdose,” researchers wrote in a journal published in the Journal of the American Medical Association’s JAMA Internal Medicine.</p>

        <p>In 2020, the NFL and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) ratified a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that introduced new guidelines for substance abuse suspensions. Among those changes was a rule stating that the NFL would no longer suspend players for testing positive for marijuana. Instead, the NFL would offer help to players if a board of trusted health officials determined it was needed. The league also raised the threshold for THC levels in drug tests significantly in the 2020 CBA. As a result, there has been a sharp decline in substance abuse-related suspensions since 2020.</p>

        <p>A study conducted in The University of Michigan in 2017 stated that in states where medical marijuana was legalized, hospitalization due to opioid abuse dropped 23 percent.</p>

        <p>Joanna Zeiger, a former Olympian and current epidemiologist, was a former cannabis skeptic turned believer. “When we looked at the positive effects of cannabis for this population, sleep, pain levels, and the ability to calm down were the most common areas where athletes saw improvement,” Zeiger said in an interview with Johns Hopkins University. “A small percentage did have adverse reactions, such as difficulty concentrating and increased anxiety.”</p>

        <p>The NFL now fines players, instead of suspending them for use of marijuana."I'm not a medical expert. We will obviously follow signs. We will follow medicine and if they determine this could be a proper usage in any context, we will consider that," said NFL Comissioner Roger Goodell in a presser in 2020. "Our medical experts are not saying that right now." Substance abuse related suspensions make up 50 percent of NFL suspensions.</p>

        <p>Today, former players have taken it upon themselves to not only use, but promote the positive effects of marijuana. One of the biggest advocates of weed is Ricky Williams.</p>

        <p>Williams played for 11 seasons in the NFL, most notably for the Miami Dolphins. Williams is second all-time in rushing yards for the Dolphins, and had an all-pro season in 2002 when he ran for a little over 1,800 yards. Williams was also suspended multiple times for marijuana use in his time in the NFL, including one year-long suspensions for the 2006 season.</p>

        <p>After his NFL career, Williams founded his own cannabis brand, Highsmith. "Whether Ricky needed to focus on a tough game ahead or disconnect from the daily grind, cannabis was a key part of his health and wellness routine. Ricky was scrutinized by the NFL and sports fans alike throughout his career, but he knew that restricting his cannabis consumption meant restricting who he truly was as an individual," reads the brand's website.</p>

        <p>"And the truth is, for football players, we do need something because it hurts, and you're all revved up and it's hard to calm down and go to sleep. And I'd love to see cannabis as being one of those things that the trainer is walking down the aisle and offering to those players," said Williams in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
